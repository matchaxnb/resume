  name: Matcha Desoutter
  label: Staff Software Engineer
  summary: >
      I am passionate about engineering, engineers, developer experience, and problem solving. I started my career in backend engineering, pushed forward with R&D, helped a number of companies transition to DevOps, and now take pride in forming communities of engineers centered around problem solving, tech stacks, and improving efficiency in this post-COVID world in which physical spaces are harder to navigate. I'm obsessive about defining the problem space well and love delivering the right solution at the right time. I also love programming and constructing beautiful software designs.
